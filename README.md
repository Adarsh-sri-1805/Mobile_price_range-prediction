# Mobile price range prediction
This project uses the main and important features of machine learning to use the data in the right way to predict the price range(0,1,2,3) of differernt mobile phones according to their specs.
The overall accuracy of the prediction model from the given training set is approximately 97%.
I used the dataset from kaggle

# Technology used
1. Pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learning
